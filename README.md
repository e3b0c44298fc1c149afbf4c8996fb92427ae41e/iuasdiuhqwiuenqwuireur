# Ultimate Ai job interview

Your task is to create a Javascript (ES6) or Typescript class which implements state management for a troubleshooting
chat bot. A basic operating principle is that the chat bot starts the conversation by asking a question about the user's
problem and presents pre-defined options for the user to choose from. When the user chooses one of the presented
options, the chat bot asks a new question with new options to find out more about the visitors problem. This
conversation continues until an end stateis reached. An end state is a state without answer options.
